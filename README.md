# Overview

The purpose of this project is to explore Lorcana data. I discovered this API endpoint through the dev console on the [Lorcania database site](https://lorcania.com/cards). It's more complete than the unofficial Lorcana API(https://lorcana-api.com/).

# Local Setup

- `python -m poetry install`
- `poetry shell`
- `python main.py`


# TODO
- Dash App?
- More text filtering
- Break out into multiple modules for pre-processing/inference/etc.
